A fast, lightweight, portable and secure runtime based on 64-bit RISC-V
Unprivileged ISA Specification.

We believe RISC-V will be the better solution than WebAssembly because the
RISC-V ISA design is more elegant. We hope through RISC-V ISA we can find a
solution that makes us less tangled with ISA designing issues and make RISC-V
ISA immortal even if no hardware uses RISC-V ISA.

## Planned Scenarios

- Softwares need plugin system
